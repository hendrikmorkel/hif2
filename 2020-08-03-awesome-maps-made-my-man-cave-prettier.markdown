Lets kick the new week off with something everyone knows and can relate to: Maps. More specifically: Awesome Maps. Awesome Maps for all your outdoor activities, from hiking and climbing to mountain biking and diving! Why? Because looking at a beautiful map in your home is second only to hiking with a map outdoors!

## Awesome Maps!

I have written about maps before (a loooong time ago [here](https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/06/waterproof-hiking-maps.html) and [here](https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html)). I ‚ù§Ô∏è Maps. I love looking at them, planning hikes with them, love reliving past trips with them, just folding them back into the original way, that I don't love that much (I'm not so good at that). A map you don't need to fold at all are the maps from [‚àû Awesome Maps](https://awesome-maps.com/?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF) as you should frame them and hang them from your wall to look at. Like my [‚àû Mountain biking World Map](https://awesome-maps.com/collections/canvas-world-maps/products/mountain-bike-mtb-trails-map-canvas?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF), which I put up in my man cave. I started to [Downhill MTB in √Öre](https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html) a few years ago and absolutely love the sport, and I found this Awesome Map the prettiest - I love the style, colours and graphics.

But Awesome Maps not only makes this Map - they make (in Germany!) [‚àû a dozen of inspiring outdoor maps](https://awesome-maps.com/pages/our-maps?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF). And you don't need to get them as a Canvas map either (though I highly recommend them!), the paper maps are just as pretty, more affordable and can also be easily hanged from the wall - either with the [‚àû handmade Oak hanging frame](https://awesome-maps.com/products/wooden-oak-poster-hangers?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF), some Blue Tac or you get it framed at your local framing business! The paper maps are made from the good stuff, too: 250 gsm art paper which is acid free and silk coated, and you even can write on them with an whiteboard marker! That's perfect if you wanna put a check ‚úÖ behind e.g. the trails you have hiked already! 

## DIY Frame for the Canvas Map

So that's the canvas map Awesome Maps sent me, together with the [‚àû DIY Wood Canvas Frame](https://awesome-maps.com/products/custom-made-diy-canvas-wood-frame-kit?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF). I wanted the canvas map as it is larger and fits better into my man cave, and I also can hang it easily from the shelves in my man cave, as you hopefully agree üòä And even if you don't agree, hanging the canvas map from the shelves means I can hide the things behind it easily! 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175336/in/dateposted/" title="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175336_671f6a922f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Assembling the DIY Frame was easy: All I needed was a hammer and a canvas stapler, both tools which I owned already. It was a easy 20 minutes task to assemble the frame and staple the canvas to it, and then it was just a question to bring the large map from the living room to the cellar!

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175451/in/dateposted/" title="Finished Awesome Map!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175451_b5b65ccd42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Finished Awesome Map!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There I used two hooks from my IKEA shelf to hang the map, and *Voil√°!* I have an awesome map to look at when I'm painting or packing or planning in my man cave!
